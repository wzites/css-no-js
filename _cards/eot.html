<h3>Eco-Organic Technology</h3>

We build eco organic systems... however we optimized our solution to minimized its ecologic footprint,

<li> compiled once deployed multiple times
<li> downloaded once locally reusable
<li> store in memory as opposed to recomputed each time
<li> serverless
<li> mobile first
<li> off-line first
<li> low bandwidth
<li> deduplicated
<li> preferably powered w/ green 
<li> reduced operation hours still preserving availability.

<h4>The eco part,</h4>
It is also avoiding big datacenter farms and prefering a peer-to-peer local approach,
minimizing "allways on" equipments for transferring the data arround the globe.

This is why all our website are static, i.e. compiled once and shipped in a cache friendly manner.
when ever it is possible we like hostless solution (via IPFS) such that file are local to our member
We also avoid bulky site, by choosing HML5 + CSS3 before using javascript.

<h4>The organic part,</h4>
As far as the organic aspect we are promoting technology in harmony w/i life, i.e. we include all living forms in the equation.
We believe entropy source are the only way to made ethical technology sensitive to live matters, any therefore
we don't have any robots without a discloded intention and a  trully random seed, making them organic
(read more about "<a href="{{baseurl}}{% post_url 2021-02-25-organic-technology %}">organic technology</a>")

All echanges and transactions on our network originated from an addressable living source, not some synthetic bots, so we always
preserve the "initial" intent within our processing.

Every seeds in our softwares are extracted from trully random entropy source such that we can carry the intent of its creator.

This is making our technolgy unique in a sense that it inherently embeded the conscious intelligence of humanity.
